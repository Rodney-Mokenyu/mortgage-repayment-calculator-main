## Overview
This Frontend Mentor project is a responsive mortgage calculator that allows users to input loan details and select a mortgage type to calculate monthly and total repayments. It features form validation, dynamic result display, and a clean, modern UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
The project began with structuring the HTML to create a user-friendly form for mortgage inputs. CSS was then used to style the layout responsively and ensure accessibility. JavaScript handled input validation, formatting, and dynamic calculations. The process involved testing, refining UI behavior, and ensuring accurate, real-time result display based on user input.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned form validation with Javascript.
I also learned how to style input placeholders using css.


### Continued development

I am still new to js and will like to develop my dom manipulation skills more.
